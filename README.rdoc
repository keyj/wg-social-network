== WG social network
This is a project, that allows people, who share an appartment (a "WG" in german) to share information like invoices for their internet and telephone-lines. 
The first version support automatic parsing of invoices from Vodafone Germany and asignes the connection-costs to the person responsible.

- This project is based on the Omniauth-Devise example app. Thanks to the guys, who put that together.
