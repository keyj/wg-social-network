== Rails3 Omniauth-Devise supercombo

As bare as you could get devise-omniauth combo

I wasn't sure why all the provider callbacks were separated as they can all be handled in the same fashion.

The Wiki also didn't mention how we should be keeping track of the user tokens in the case we want to allow the user to validate multiple providers.

So I created a basic model storing the user_id, provider, & uid.
